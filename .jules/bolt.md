## 2024-05-22 - Frontend Verification in Static Environment
**Learning:** For static HTML projects without a Node.js build system, Python's `http.server` combined with a Playwright script (running in a separate process) is a reliable way to verify frontend performance optimizations like lazy loading.
**Action:** Use `python3 -m http.server` and a companion verification script for future frontend tasks in this environment.
